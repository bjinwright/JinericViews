JinericViews - Django class based generic views and admin for Google App Engine (GAE)
This is not production ready as I have not included any tests. If you notice something is wrong drop me a note or fork.

SAMPLE CUSTOMIZATION OF ADMIN CLASS
from jinericviews.views.crud import JinericAdmin
from jinericviews.actions import DeleteAction
from jinericviews.filters import KeyFilter,BooleanFilter

class MultimediaAdmin(JinericAdmin):
    list_display = ('title','publish_status','featured')
    list_filters = (BooleanFilter('publish_status','Publish Status'),BooleanFilter('featured','Featured'))
    login_required = True
    paginate_by = 10
    post_create_append_key = False
    post_update_append_key = False
    actions = [DeleteAction,FeatureAction,UnFeatureAction,PublishAction,UnPublishAction] 

SAMPLE VIEWS
#Channel Views
ca = MultimediaAdmin(Channel) #Channel is a GAE model
ca.form_class = ChannelForm #You guessed it ChannelForm is a Django form this is required polymodels

#Playlist Views
pa = MultimediaAdmin(Playlist)
pa.form_class = PlaylistForm
pa.list_filters = pa.list_filters + (KeyFilter('channel','Channel'),)

#Media Views
ma = MultimediaAdmin(Media)
ma.list_display = ma.list_display
ma.form_class = MediaForm
ma.list_filters = ma.list_filters + (KeyFilter('playlist_list','Playlist'),)

SAMPLE URL CONFIGURATION
from django.conf.urls.defaults import *
from multimedia.views import ca, pa, ma

urlpatterns = patterns('',
    url(r'^', include(ca.urls)),
    url(r'^', include(pa.urls)),
    url(r'^', include(ma.urls)),
)
